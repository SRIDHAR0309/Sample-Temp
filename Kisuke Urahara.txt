Kisuke Urahara: "Ah, greetings, young Shinigami! I see you're on a quest to uncover the secret key to the Zanpakuto. I can assist you, but first, you must solve a small puzzle."

Participant: "Hello, Kisuke Urahara! We’re ready for your help. What do we need to do?"

Kisuke Urahara:
	"Ah, I see you’ve decided to start, huh? 😏 So, you’re here for the first part of the key? Heh, good luck with that! 🍀
You know, I’ve never been one for coding or tech—those things bore me. 💤 But hiding secrets? Now that’s a game I enjoy! 🕵️‍♂️
I’ve hidden clues in the most unexpected places, even within this very file you’re reading. But will you be sharp enough to find it? 🔍
Or will you waste your time trying to decipher some silly code? 🧑‍💻

If you think you’re up to the challenge, go ahead—give it a shot! 🎯 But I warn you, you might just end up spending all your time with me, learning the nuances of something I couldn’t care less about. 😌 The key is within your reach… if you can find it! 🔑"

Kisuke Urahara: sleeping… 😴

Kisuke Urahara:
"What? You found the 1st digit already, huh? 😳 Okay, now understand & solve the below program:"
